# Lines starting with # are ignored

# This controls what address / port the server listens on
# As of tircd 0.3, the server only listens on localhost by default, but you can change that below
# Comment out the address line to listen on all interface
address 127.0.0.1
port 6667


## SSL Support
# set use_ssl to 1 to have the tircd daemon use SSL when connecting to twitter
use_ssl 0
# If tircd is not being started with either HTTPS_CA_FILE or HTTPS_CA_DIR 
# environment variable set, AT LEAST one of the following must be set. These
# tell Crypt::SSLeay where to find the local root certificate store.
# https_ca_dir  /usr/share/ca-certificates/
# https_ca_file /etc/certs/ca-bundle.crt 
https_ca_dir 
https_ca_file 


# This controls where tircd will store it's configuration data
# This is used to store per-user preferences and channel lineups
# If not set, data will not be saved between user sessions
storage_path /tmp/tircd

# This controls how POE logs data
# Current options for logtype are 'stdout', 'stderr', 'file', or 'none', 
# If file is chosen logfile must be set to a path for the log file
logtype stdout

# All settings below this line are user configurable. Settings below will be used as defaults until a user opts to change them
# See the /stats command for settings these parameters on a per-user basis

# This controls how often we check with twitter for updates (in seconds)
# Currently The twitter API enforces a limit of 350 api calls per hour
# Updating the timeline takes 2 calls, while direct messages takes 1  
# It's a good idea to ensure your settings don't cause tircd to make more calls than that our you'll get errors
# The default settings will cause ~ 60 calls per hour
update_timeline 180
update_directs 180

# This controls how many updates we'll ask from twitter at a time.  Valid values are 1 to 200.  The default is 20
timeline_count 20

# This controls how we handle tweets longer than 140 characters. There are three options
# ignore - This is the default behavior, tircd will not do any checking and just pass what is entered to twitter.  Twitter will automatically cut off messages longer than 140 chars.
# warn   - tircd will warn you that the message was too long, and it will not be sent.
# split  - tircd will split your message into multiple tweets.  The min_length setting is the minimum length a split message has to be to send.  This keeps tircd from sending a 1 character tweet if you had entered 141 characters.
# Be careful with the split option, it can send many tweets at once if you enter a long message, and annoy your followers.
long_messages ignore
min_length 20

# This controls how tircd behaves when you join #twitter. 
# 0 - This is the default behaivor, when joining #twitter, you will receive the 20 most recent updates, @replies, and dms.
# 1 - tircd will be silent when joining the channel, and only show new messages / dms as they come in.
join_silent 0

# Until 0.9 tircd would filter out messages sent by you from other clients, so only traffic sent from irc would show up.
# You can now set this as an option, if you want to see your update from other clients, set this to 0.  1 is the default and previous behaivor.
# Note: this can cause duplicate messages to show, as timeline updates can be delayed coming back from twitter.
filter_self 1

# tircd will use the tinyurl api to automatically shorten URLs in your tweets if this is set to one.
# You must also have the URI::Find module installed so tircd can extract the URLs from your message
shorten_urls 1

# tircd will automtaiccally expand URLs in your timeline from the default t.co-URLs (I.E. show the original URL in your timeline
# This does not currently work for searches
expand_urls 1

# If set tircd will concert <username>: <msg> replies into @<username> <msg> replies so you can use your irc client's tab complettion 
# Currently '<username>: ' must be at the start of the message, and the user must be in #twitter for this to work.
convert_irc_replies 0

# If set, tircd will show users realname in your timeline next to the @username
show_realname 1
